    <p> An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples.
        The earliest printed recipe is from England. Apple pie is often served 
        with whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie Ã  la mode"), or cheddar cheese.
        [3] It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the 
        filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). 
        The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it from getting 
        soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only. Tarte Tatin is baked with 
        the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.
